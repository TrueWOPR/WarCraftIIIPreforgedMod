	The Warcraft III Expansion World Editor allows the creation of scenario, campaign and multiplayer maps. This is the most complete design tool Blizzard Entertainment has ever released to the public. This editor is virtually unchanged from the editor the level designers used to create their maps.<br>
	<br>
	If you were a user of the Warcraft III Editor, you will find all of the 
    tools still available, easier to use, and generally more powerful. The 
    Object Editor has a slew of new tools for custom object creation to populate 
    your map with units, items, doodads, abilities and upgrades of your own 
    design. With the addition of the AI Editor, you can develop automated armies 
    for your campaigns or test your skills against your own army. If you're more 
    interested in creating epic quests, use the Campaign Editor to manage your 
    multi-map campaign. The new multi-function triggers and the quantity of new 
    functions in the Trigger Editor make managing your triggers easier and more 
    versatile.</p>

	This help file is designed to be a general reference manual rather than an instruction book. The scope of the World Editor's power is too great to be covered in any great detail here. We recommend that you experiment and do research on the Web; there are sure to be a lot of sites with information and tips on using this program.<br>
	<br>
	We wish you many hours of enjoyment with this new editor. We can't wait to see some great maps!<br>
