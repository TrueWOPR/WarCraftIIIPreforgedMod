	<p class="large_header_blue">World Editor Features and Navigation<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="Navigating">Navigating Your Map</a>
	<p class="normal_white">
	There are many ways to navigate your map.  You can move up and down or left and right by using the scrollbars or the arrow keys on your keyboard.  You can also move around by right-clicking on your map and dragging.  Alternatively, you can change positions by left-clicking the minimap and dragging.<br>
	<br>
	Due to the three-dimensional nature of Warcraft III maps, you now have the option to zoom in on and rotate your map. You can zoom in or out by holding down the shift key and right-clicking and dragging on your map. You can rotate your map by holding down the Control key and right-clicking and dragging on your map. If you press the C key to lock the game camera, you can then use the game's conventions for zooming in and rotating.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="Previewer">Previewer</a>
	<p class="normal_white">
	The previewer is the box on the left side of your screen that allows you to see each unit or doodad you select before you place it on the map. You can rotate and zoom in or out relative to each unit or doodad by using the arrows buttons located underneath the previewer. You can also see each animation under the various lighting options available by clicking on the arrows next to the associated time of day.<br>
	<br>
	With the Doodad Palette you can see all variations of a doodad in the previewer, and you can decide which variation you would like to place, provided you do not have Place Random Variation option checked.  Once you've chosen a doodad to place in your map, you can see any available variations or animations of the selected doodad by clicking the up and down arrows next to the word Variation or the word Animation on the left side of the editor.  If you do not have Random Rotation depressed, you can rotate the doodad you place by rotating it in the previewer.<br>
	<br>
	Using the Unit Palette, you can see all the available animations for a selected unit by clicking the up and down arrows next to the word Animation on the left side of the editor.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="Brush">Brush List</a>
	<p class="normal_white">
	The brush list is an alternative to the palettes. However, it only allows you to select the terrain, units, and doodads associated with the tileset you chose when you first created the map. For 
    instance, if you choose Lordaeron Summer as your tileset, only the units and doodads that fall under that tileset will be available in the brush list. The brush list also doesn't offer some of the other features of the palettes, such as brush size, and random rotation.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="Status">Status Bar</a>
	<p class="normal_white">
	The status bar is beneath the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of the editor window; it provides you with information about what you are currently doing.  It is divided into four sections from left to right.<br>
	<br>
	The first section displays the current position in (X, Y, Z) coordinates of the cursor, and the current cliff level of the terrain the cursor is above.<br>
	<br>
	The second section displays what brush is currently being used.  If you are modifying terrain, it will tell you your brush size, shape, and what type of brush you are using.  If you are modifying doodads or units, the status bar will tell you what doodad or unit you are placing.  If you are modifying regions, the status bar will simply say "Regions."  This section will also tell you if you have the selection brush active.<br>
	<br>
	The third section shows what, if anything, is currently selected on your map. If you have an object selected, it tells you the object's name, the order in which it was placed on the map (e.g., Paladin 0000 was the first unit placed on the map; this number only applies to units), its four-letter code (if the object is a unit or doodad), its owner (if it is a unit), and its level (if it is a 
    Hero, a creep, or a critter).<br>
	<br>
	The fourth section tells you what game time the editor is currently displaying.  This time can be a set, unchanging time, but its default setting follows the normal day/night cycle.  This section also shows whether the map you are working on is a melee map.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	
	<a class="small_header_blue" name="Minimap">Minimap</a>
	<p class="normal_white">
	The minimap displays the terrain, units, doodads, and regions placed on your map from an overhead perspective.
