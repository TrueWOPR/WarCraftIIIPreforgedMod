	<p class="normal_white">
	This is another powerful addition to the World Editor, and it is recommended that you become familiar with the game before you use it, lest you delve too deeply into the inner workings of the game too quickly. To open the Unit Editor, use F6, or choose Unit Editor from the Module window. Here's a short definition of the items you can adjust in the Unit Editor.
