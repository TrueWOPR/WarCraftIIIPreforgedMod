This free Technical Support service is offered Monday through Friday, from 10 A.M. to 12 P.M. and from 2 P.M. to 6 P.M., Pacific Time (except on holidays).<br>	<br>	If you are new to the Battle.net service and would like additional help trying to use Battle.net's features, go to: <a class="normal_white" border="0" href="http://www.Battle.net/intro.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.Battle.net/intro.shtml</a>.<br>	<br>	You will need to connect to the US West Battle.net server. Once you are in the chat area with other players, type "/join Blizzard Tech Support" (without quotes) in the chat field and press "Enter" on the keyboard. The Blizzard Tech Support channel is moderated, so only Blizzard Representatives will be able to see the messages you send to the channel.  Customers are helped in the order they appear on the Blizzard Representative's screen.	</p>	<br>	<br>	<br>					<a name="List" class="small_header_blue">	List of Chat Commands	</a>	<p>	<i class="oblique_blue">Note for Macintosh users:</i> References to ALT key shortcuts below are not valid for the Macintosh version of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.	</p>	<i class="oblique_blue">		Universal Chat Commands	</i>	<p class="normal_white">	The following commands can be used in any chat channel.

When a user lists their friends, he or she will receive information about all of their friends in digest form. This will allow at a glance to see which of your friends are online. The digest information is similar to the current output of the /whois command. For each user you will see which program they are using and which channel/game they are in (so long as it's a public channel/game). For Diablo II the name of the game is not revealed (even if it's public).<br>	<br>		<i class="oblique_yellow">		Mutual Friend (or Close Friend)	</i>	<br>	Since we want to provide more features to users who trust each other, if users add each other to their friends list they will be considered mutual friends. When enumerating friends, mutual friends will have their channel/game name revealed even if the user is in a private channel/game so that they can always find each other. When mutual friends perform certain actions they may be notified.

To use a shortcut use %f[num], where num refers to your friend by their position in you friends list. For example, to whisper to your number-one friend, you would use /msg %f1 hi there.	</p>	<br>			<i class="oblique_blue">		Other Information	</i>	<p class="normal_white">	When /dnd is activated, you will not receive entry notifications from mutual friends.<br>	<br>	If you attempt to add a person that is already on your friends list, you will receive a notification that the person you are attempting to add is already on your friends list.	</p>	</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
