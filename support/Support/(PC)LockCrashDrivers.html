For example; if you are playing on a system with only 128MB of RAM, Windows 98 will use approximately 5MB of your available RAM, which will cause Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne to use virtual memory. Virtual memory emulates system RAM by using space on the hard drive, which is much slower than actual system RAM.<br>	<br>	Windows XP requires 64MB of system RAM (128MB recommended) but will rely heavily on virtual memory if you only have 128MB installed. This process is slower than using system RAM directly, and while the speed of your processor is a factor in the performance of the game, additional memory can improve your game speed, especially on systems that only meet the minimum requirements for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.	</p>	<br>	<br>				<a name="Background" class="small_header_blue">	Disable Background Applications	</a>	<p class="normal_white">	Programs that run in the background, such as web browsers, instant messaging services, media programs, and voice communication applications, cut into the speed at which Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne plays. In order to increase your game speed, quit open applications before you play.<br>	<br>	To display a list of all currently running programs, hold down CTL-ALT-DEL. This will display the Task Manager.<br>	<br>	From there, select a program and click on the "End Task" button. Repeat this for each task on the list except "Explorer" and "Systray". "Explorer" and "Systray" should remain running. Once all tasks other than "Explorer" have been ended, click on the "Cancel" button and try to install Warcraft III again.	</p>	<br>	<br>			<a name="Scan" class="small_header_blue">	Run Scandisk and Defrag	</a>	<p class="normal_white">	It is good practice to run Scandisk and Defrag regularly to keep your system file management at peak performance.
