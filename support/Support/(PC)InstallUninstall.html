First, back up any single-player profiles in the Warcraft III/save folder and maps from the Warcraft III/maps folder to a safe place.  Next, make sure that any previous installations of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne are completely removed.  After you uninstall the game, delete the Warcraft III folder from your hard drive manually and empty your Recycle Bin.	</p>	</p class="normal_white">	<i class="oblique_blue">	To Uninstall Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne:	</i>	<ul>	<li class="normal_white">Click on the "Start" button.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">Select "Programs" and then "Warcraft III".</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">Click on the "Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne Uninstall" icon.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">The uninstall process will begin.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">After you uninstall the game, delete the Warcraft III folder from your hard drive manually and empty your Recycle Bin.</li>	<br>	</ul>	</p>	<p class="normal_white">	For users who are running multiple operating systems on one computer, (for example both Windows 98 and Windows XP), please note that you must uninstall Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne from the same operating system under which it was installed.

If the sticker with the CD-Key is missing, return the game to the place of purchase.	<br>	<br>	The CD-Key is required each time you install Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.  For this reason, we recommend that you manually copy the CD-Key to a text document, and save that text document in a secure location.  Treat the CD-Key as confidential information.  Never reveal it to anyone, and avoid installing the game with the same CD-Key on more than one computer at a time.	<br>	<br>	If for any reason, you should lose the CD-Key, the CD-Key should fail to authenticate on Battle.net, or the CD-Key becomes smudged, we will replace the CD-Key only under the following conditions.	<br>	<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">	<li class="normal_white">You mail the CD case to us.</li>	<br>	<br>		<li class="normal_white">If it has been less than 90 days since you purchased the game, you must mail us a photocopy of the sales receipt.
