If the sticker with the CD-Key is missing, return the game to the place of purchase.	<br>	<br>	The CD-Key is required each time you install Warcraft III Frozen Throne.  For this reason, we recommend that you manually copy the CD-Key to a text document, and save that text document in a secure location.  Treat the CD-Key as confidential information.  Never reveal it to anyone, and avoid installing the game with the same CD-Key on more than one computer at a time.	<br>	<br>	If for any reason, you should lose the CD-Key, the CD-Key should fail to authenticate on Battle.net, or the CD-Key becomes smudged, we will replace the CD-Key only under the following conditions.	<br>	<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">	<li class="normal_white">You mail the CD case to us.</li>	<br>	<br>		<li class="normal_white">If it has been less than 90 days since you purchased the game, you must mail us a photocopy of the sales receipt.
