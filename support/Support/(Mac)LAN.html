Using such programs will adversely affect the performance of Warcraft III. We recommend you quit as many running applications as you can before you start the Warcraft III application.	</p>	<p class="oblique_yellow">	Setting Up Peer to Peer TCP/IP in Mac OS X:	<br>	<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">	<li class="normal_white">Open the System Preferences application.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">Select the Network Panel.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">Select the TCP/IP tab.</li>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">If you are using a DHCP router or proxy server, enter the address of the router and skip the next two steps.

Warcraft III applications which are patched to a higher version number will not communicate properly with Warcraft III applications which are patched to a lower version number.	</p>	<br>	<br>			<a name="Sharing" class="small_header_blue">		Port Mapping Information for Shared Internet Connections	</a>	<p class="normal_white">		Internet connection sharing devices, such as broadband routers and proxy servers which utilize "network address translation" technology, require special configuration for use with The Frozen Throne.  Consult the documentation which came with your router or proxy server to find out how to enable and configure "Port Forwarding" features.	<br>	<br>	Step-by-step configuration information will vary based on the manufacturer of your router or proxy server.  In general you need to do the following.	<br>	<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">	<li class="normal_white">		Configure your router or proxy server to assign a static IP address to each computer on your local area network.	</li><br>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">		Assign to each IP address you have created on the L.A.N. a single, unique port number between 1024 and 49151.  Take care not to use the same port for more than one IP address on your L.A.N. and record for future reference what port you assign to each IP address.	</li><br>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">		Set all the forwarded port numbers to pass only UDP and TCP packets.  If you have a firewall set up you will need to repeat this step for the same ports on your firewall.	</li><br>	</ol>	When you are ready to play The Frozen Throne, you will need to first find out what IP address your computer is set to use.  Next you will need to set the "Game Port" option for The Frozen Throne to match the port number your router or proxy server is set to forward to your computer's IP address.  To set the "Game Port" option, use the steps below.	<br>	<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">	<li class="normal_white">		Find the application icon for The Frozen Throne on your hard drive and double-click it.	</li><br>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">		When the "Main Menu" screen appears for The Frozen Throne, click once on the "Options" button.	</li><br>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">		Click once on the "Gameplay" button.	</li><br>	<br>	<li class="normal_white">		Click once on the "Game Port" text area and type in the port number which has been assigned to the IP address your computer is set to use.	</li><br>	</ol>	</p>	<br>	<br>			<a name="Latency" class="small_header_blue">		How to Correct Network Latency Issues	</a>	<p class="normal_white">	Multiplayer games are always limited to the speed (latency) of the slowest connection.  If you are using a mixed 10/100/1000BaseT network, the game should be hosted on a computer with a fast network connection.  To accelerate performance on computers with slow network connections, turn down game features such as texturing, lighting and resolution. Turn off environmental audio and music.	<br>	<br>	The most common causes of network latency are loose or damaged network cables.  If you notice slow performance even with game features turned down or off, check the connections at each computer's Ethernet port and check the connections at the hubs, switches, routers and proxy servers on your network.  Look for pinches, tears, sharp bends and broken connectors on Ethernet cables.  If you have a cable tester, you might also test each cable.	</p>	</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body>
