If the beta is not uninstalled first, the expansion will not launch properly.		</p>		<br>		<a name="Errata" class="small_header_blue">			Manual Errata		</a>		<br>		<br>				<a name="Classic" class="small_header_blue">			Classic Mode		</a>		<p>		Running in Warcraft III Classic mode gives you access to the original campaign levels as well as the Warcraft III classic game style.  Notable differences between Classic mode and Frozen Throne are outlined below.		</p>		<ul>		<li>Some balance numbers (attack damage, speed, etc.) are different between versions.</li><br>		<li>The food cap is set to 90 in classic, but is set to 100 in Frozen Throne.</li><br>		<li>In Frozen Throne, when no Heroes are present in a battle, experience is split amongst all existing friendly and allied Heroes on the map.</li><br>		<li>Killing creeps in Frozen Throne does not award experience to Heroes mid-level or above.  Defeating an enemy player's units will award experience to heros of any level.</li><br>		<li>Upkeep thresholds, which are set to 40 and 70 in Classic, are set to 50 and 80 in Frozen Throne.</li><br>		<li>Hostile auras, such as Thorns Aura and Vampiric Aura will affect magic-immune units in Frozen Throne, but will not affect magic-immune units in Classic.</li><br>		<li>All hero ultimate abilities should affect magic-immune creatures in Frozen Throne (e.g., Bladestorm, Death And Decay, Starfall, Charm, Earthquake).  Hero ultimate abilities will not effect magic-immune creatures in Classic.</li><br>		<li>Targeted healing spells (Healing Wave, Death Coil, and Holy Light) are currently permitted on magic-immune units in Frozen Throne. However, their hostile uses, if any, are still not permitted to affect magic-immune units. Thus, Death Coil can heal an Undead magic-immune unit, but it cannot damage an enemy magic-immune unit.</li><br>		<li>Entangling Roots, Ensnare, and other immobilizers, with the exception of Blink will not prevent teleportation, may not be dispelled, and may be used to target magic-immune units when used in Frozen Throne.  The same immobilizers will prevent teleportation, may be dispelled, and may not be used to target magic-immune units in Classic.</li><br>		<li>In Frozen Throne, units can become ethereal in certain situations. Ethereal units cannot be harmed physically, but take extra damage from spells and Magic attacks (i.e., attacks of casters such as Sorceresses and Banshees). Also, ethereal units cannot physically attack, but they can still cast spells and will take bonus healing from healing spells.</li><br>		<li>Transport Ship units are only available in Frozen Throne.</li><br><br>		<li><i class="oblique_blue">Night Elves</i></li><br><br>		<li>In Frozen Throne, all Ancients can attack while rooted, and the Treant (from the spell Force of Nature) now benefits from Nature's Blessing.</li><br>		<li>The Druid of the Talon's Cyclone spell can be dispelled in Frozen Throne.</li><br>		<li>The Night Elf Archer may dismount from a Hippogryph in Frozen Throne, so that a Hippogryph Rider may revert into an Archer and Hippogryph.  This is not possible in Classic.</li><br><br>		<li><i class="oblique_blue">Orcs</i></li><br><br>		<li>If a Blademaster in Wind Walk attacks a unit to break invisibility, he will deal bonus damage in Frozen Throne.</li><br><br>		<li><i class="oblique_blue">Undead</i></li><br><br>		<li>Units summoned by the Death Knight's Animate Dead spell are, in Frozen Throne, invulnerable to attacks and magic. However, they can be dispelled.</li>		</ul>		<br>		<i class="oblique_yellow">			Aliases		</i>		<br>		<ul>		<li>To create a new desktop alias for the Classic version of Warcraft III, use the following steps.</li><br>			<ul>			<li>Find and open the Warcraft III folder on your hard drive.</li><br>			<li>Click on the Warcraft III application icon.</li><br>			<li>Select Make Alias in the File menu.</li><br>			<li>Move the Alias to the location you want it.</li><br>			</ul>		</ul>	</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
