-=WarCraft III Preforged Total Conversion Mod=-
Simply extract the included files to your Warcraft III directory.
The mod does *NOT* include the games .mpq files, you'll need to download reforged to access those.
Alternatively, since classic is now Free to Play, you can find a mirror of the reforged mpq files in the below link.
